# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Data Structure And Algorithms Using graph alogrithms 
Rubiks cube solver using graph algorithms 
1)Dfs
2)Bfs
Task 1 Representing the cube and it states
Task 2 Displaying the cube and to be able to perform 12 standard operations
Taks 3 Applying Graph algorithsm such as Bfs,Dfs and IDDFS to solve the the unsolved cube .
By converting the cube in solved state and displaying the moves (standard moves which were used to solve this from unsolved state to solved state).
